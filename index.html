                <p>Thanks to our high tunnels, greenhouses, and row covers, we grow fresh vegetables throughout all seasons. While summer brings our peak harvest of warm-season crops, we continue producing cold-hardy vegetables like kale, leeks, carrots, and potatoes well into fall and winter.</p>
                <p><strong>Coming This Fall:</strong> Fresh harvested leeks, storage potatoes, and sweet carrots. Kale returns with the cooler weather!</p>
